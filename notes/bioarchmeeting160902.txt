Theres a file called mammalian collagen sequence. Use this to find the species sequence. 

look up the sequence - check the probability of hydroxylation - and look also at deamidation. 

This means we can make all 


Sugar residues - top two rows give the probablilty that a sugar is attacked to a K..


Christine will convert DNA to protein sequences and then look that up. - Christine will have the MALDI MS and the DNA sequece - look for where things are -- cheap way of mapping hydroxylation. We can't do the hydroxylationproperly sometimes you get a big lump. 


Mamalian collagen seq


There'll be a mammal, fish and bird sequence. - the are equevalent FASTA files for this, but they are harder to annotate. 


We want something to scale


Wantst to run through every 'cut' in the seqence - apart from column ANU. everything to the right should be present in 1/2 quantities - we'd like to say what a 'bad' spectrum is. There'll be a number of masses that are identical, even though they are from completely different sequences..

SO- the first thing to do is generate a *completely* theoretical sequence - see what that looks like

Humans can't make vitamin C - so there should be  difference between humans and sheepcowgoat, because they can - so they are less likely to be hydroxylated. 


#STAGES OF ANALYSIS - PLAN1

##Generate the theroretical masses

- Use googlesheets to access the data
- Find the row corresponding to the species
- Generate the sequence fragments by split at K
- For each subsequence
	- Record the sequence
    - then check for Xs (unknowns) 
    - if there's not too many Xs, check for prob of hydroxylation and deamidation
- Plot the theoretical masses that work. Adjust the relative masses

##Compare with sample data

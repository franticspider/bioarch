##Generate the theroretical masses
#- Use googlesheets to access the data
#- Find the row corresponding to the species
#- Generate the sequence fragments by split at K
#- For each subsequence
#	- Record the sequence
#    - then check for Xs (unknowns) 
#    - if there's not too many Xs, check for prob of hydroxylation and deamidation
#- Plot the theoretical masses that work. Adjust the relative masses















##Compare with sample data
